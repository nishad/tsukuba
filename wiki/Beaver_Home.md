Locations
---------

-   In [Ryugasaki](/wiki/Ryugasaki "wikilink") near that red-coloured iron
    bridge on the way to [Toride](/wiki/Toride "wikilink").

Clone of Joyful?
----------------

The layout, size and contents of the Ryugasaki store are astonishingly
close to those of the [Moriya](/wiki/Moriya "wikilink") [Joyful
Honda](/wiki/Joyful_Honda "wikilink"). Someone must have copied someone, it
seems.

Recommendations
---------------

The only place I have found in Japan which sells sheets of MDF.
