What is Tsukuba?
----------------

For most foreigners, Tsukuba is a transient community where they stay
for only a year or two before moving on to somewhere else. Most of these
people don't speak Japanese and don't have access to local information.
Thus the need for information in English or other languages is enormous.

What help exists?
-----------------

At the moment, there are already tons of resources available for
foreigners in Tsukuba. Many [books](/wiki/Books "wikilink"),
[pamphlets](/wiki/TsukubaWiki:Tsukuba_Pamphlets "wikilink") and [web
sites](/wiki/Websites "wikilink") about Tsukuba already exist.

What problems are there with existing information?
--------------------------------------------------

There are several problems with the existing sources of information:

### They rapidly get old

For example, a great list of information for newcomers was provided by
Eleanor Olds Batchelder only a couple of years ago. However, with the
rapid changes in the centre of Tsukuba with the coming of the new train
station, a lot of the information in Eleanor's list is already out of
date.

### Making information takes time

For one person, organizing information about a city of Tsukuba's size is
a full time job.

### Updating takes time

Printed books are difficult to update. Keeping web sites up to date is
also tough work.

### No single person knows enough to do a really good job

There is so much information that needs to be included, about all manner
of things that people need to know about, like
[health](health "wikilink"), [restaurants](restaurants "wikilink"),
[pets](pets "wikilink"), that no one person can master it all.

### People leave

Because this is such a transient community, most of the people who wrote
the guide books to Tsukuba ten or twenty years ago no longer even live
here.

How does a Wiki help?
---------------------

A Wiki solves all of these problems.

### Wikis are fast

Wiki is actually a Hawaiian word meaning *fast*. Anyone can edit the
Tsukuba Wiki.

### Updating is easy

Anyone can update the Wiki instantly.

### Everyone can help

If everyone living in Tsukuba contributes even a little to this Wiki, it
will soon be the best information resource available anywhere about this
town.

### Wikis don't get old

As soon as an entry starts looking old, someone can easily update it.
This is the complete opposite of a printed book which just gets older
and older, and less and less relevant.

### Wikis don't take up time

Because everyone is cooperating together, the Wiki doesn't end up being
a great burden for just one or two people.

### Wikis don't depend on any one person

Even if some of the contributors leave Tsukuba or leave Japan, the Wiki
can be continued by new people, without the burden of having to start
something from the beginning.

OK, Wikis are great! What can I do?
-----------------------------------

You can do anything, including reorganizing the information and adding
stuff about whatever you think is important.

Get started today with your favourite article.

I want to help but my English is no good
----------------------------------------

Never mind! What is important is to get out the useful information about
Tsukuba, not writing perfect English. Write something and let someone
else edit it into good English for you.

I have an idea for Tsukuba Wiki, what do you think?
---------------------------------------------------

Don't talk about it, do it!

Is it OK to add to someone else's pages?
----------------------------------------

**YES!!!!** If you have something useful to say, please go ahead and say
it. You don't need permission. Most of these pages are "stubs",
placeholders put there as starting points for you to add to.

If you do make a mess, other people can probably sort it out. Don't be
surprised if your edits are rapidly modified.

The only thing you should be cautious about is **deleting** other
people's information. Please don't delete stuff which might be useful
for someone. Please only delete stuff which clearly doesn't belong here
or is obviously wrong.
