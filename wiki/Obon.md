This is a major Japanese holiday (Buddhist). Dates vary around the
country, but center around the 13th to the 17th (although it is held in
July in some areas). During the time of O-bon, a family's ancestors come
back home for a visit. This means that all family members are generally
obliged to make the trip back to their hometowns in order to participate
in various family functions. Because so many people who live in Tsukuba
actually come from other parts of Japan, O-bon can be fairly quiet
around these parts. You will probably find that most of your Japanese
friends have either left town or are extremely busy with family
commitments. Many stores and services are unavailable during this time,
especially smaller businesses.
