Russian Vodka Ceremony (RVC) is for football (soccer) lovers. We are
inviting new players. Every Sunday (weather permitting), we practice
from 2 p.m. at AIST-West, previously known as NIRE, on Nishi-O-dori just
opposite the flashing tower that is next to Doho Park. Newcomers are
welcome to join our club. If you are interested in RVC activities,
please join us at AIST-West on Sunday.

[Abbreviation](/wiki/Abbreviations "wikilink"): RVC
