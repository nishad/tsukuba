Similar to [100 Yen Shops](100_Yen_Shops "wikilink"), everything here
sells for 100 yen plus tax (so 105 yen). The bill is calculated based on
the number of plates remaining. These places are invariably also
[Conveyor belt sushi](/wiki/Conveyor_belt_sushi "wikilink") places, although
not all conveyor belt places are 100 yen.
