Science Square Tsukuba is a museum that highlights some of the exciting
research that is happening at the National Institute of Advanced
Industrial Science and Technology (AIST). You might think that a museum
about research would be boring, but that is not the case for Science
Square Tsukuba. At this museum, you can get a sense of what life will be
like in the near future. It's almost like going to a science fiction
museum, but in this case, it is science factâ€”or soon to be fact! The
best part about this museum is that you are allowed to touch and
interact with some of the displays.

Exhibits
--------

Here are some of the exhibits you can see at Science Square Tsukuba.

-   Meet Paro, the therapeutic robot. He is shaped like a baby harp seal
    and responds to your touch just like a real animal. He is used in
    pet therapy sessions at pediatric wards and homes for the elderly.

<!-- -->

-   Try out the Aimulet, a battery-less information terminal that gives
    you relevant information about the displays you are looking at.

<!-- -->

-   Learn about microfactories, a new concept in
    environmentally-friendly manufacturing. See the desktop hanko
    (signature seal) factory that makes the idea of the microfactory
    easy to understand.

<!-- -->

-   See how light can be used to purify air and water. This is a
    revolutionary concept that uses the photocatalystic properties of
    titanium dioxide to turn harmful materials into more benign ones.

<!-- -->

-   Find out the exact measurements of your feet. A short, simple scan
    of your foot can give you your actual foot size, including length,
    width, thickness, and other dimensions. Maybe one day we can all
    have shoes that are tailored to our actual foot sizes!

Opening Hours
-------------

The museum is open from 9:30am to 5pm on weekdays (Monday to Friday) and
it is closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and national holidays.

There are 90 minute tours starting at 10am and 2pm.
