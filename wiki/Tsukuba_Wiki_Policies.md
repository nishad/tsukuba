These are some guidelines that we are trying to follow. If they are
confusing, don't worry too much about them. We can edit any entry to
make it match the rest of the site if necessary.

We want to make your experience fun and worthwhile, so we promise not to
make too many rules!

Abbreviations
-------------

The main page for any entry should have the full title in the name. For
example, the main page for the Public Works Research Institute should be
called "Public Works Research Institute". A second page called "PWRI"
should redirect the reader to the page [Public Works Research
Institute](/wiki/Public_Works_Research_Institute "wikilink").

Order of Entries
----------------

When a list has more than three or four entries, please alphabetize the
entries.

Romanization
------------

In general, follow the [Hepburn](/wiki/Wikipedia:Hepburn "wikilink") pattern
of romanization (rather than [Kunrei](/wiki/Wikipedia:Kunrei "wikilink")).

Names of places in Tsukuba should follow the "easy to read" romanization
that is listed on the following page.
