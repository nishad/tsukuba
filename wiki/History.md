Tsukuba is a planned city that came into existence as a result of a plan
that received approval from the Japanese cabinet in 1973. On November
30, 1987, [Oho Town](/wiki/Oho "wikilink"), [Toyosato
Town](/wiki/Toyosato "wikilink"), [Yatabe Town](Yatabe "wikilink"), and
[Sakura Village](/wiki/Sakura "wikilink") merged to become Tsukuba City.
Tsukuba City, also known as Tsukuba Science City, became the 20th new
city in [Ibaraki](/wiki/Ibaraki "wikilink") Prefecture and the 655th new city
in Japan. [Tsukuba Town](/wiki/Tsukuba "wikilink") merged with Tsukuba City
the following year, and on November 1, 2002, [Kukizaki
Town](/wiki/Kukizaki "wikilink") completed the process.
