TWMC was founded in May 1998, with the aim to provide walks at all
levels to give everyone the chance to experience the natural beauty of
Japan, and, of course, to also leave no onsen untested! There is no
formal membership and, consequently, no regular membership fee; you
automatically become a member by joining one of the club's walks.

To cover the cost of maps and club equipment we do, however, ask hike
participants to pay a club fee of 500 yen for daytrips and 1000 yen for
longer walks.

Meetings every Wednesday night at [Hot Stuff](/wiki/Hot_Stuff "wikilink") from
9pm.
