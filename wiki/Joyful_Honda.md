Enormous home centre. This place has just about anything you could want
and they claim that it is possible to build an entire home with products
from this store. The [Moriya](/wiki/Moriya "wikilink") store is apparently
even bigger than the [Arakawaoki](/wiki/Arakawaoki "wikilink") one. There is
also a jigsaw puzzle shop and a [McDonald's](/wiki/McDonald's "wikilink")
here, as well as the sports centre [Joyful
Athletic](/wiki/Joyful_Athletic "wikilink") opposite.

Also has an amazing "pet centre" which is worth a visit even if you're
not planning to buy anything.

[Foods Land Crocodile](/wiki/Foods_Land_Crocodile "wikilink") (sic) on the
premises serves [tako yaki](tako_yaki "wikilink") and other such fare.

There is a big art shop as well.
