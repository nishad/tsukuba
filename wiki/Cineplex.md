Cineplex (in [Tsukuba You World](/wiki/Tsukuba_You_World "wikilink") on [Route
354](/wiki/Noda_Sen "wikilink") at the southern part of the city) has various
deals so you should never have to pay full price (1800 yen) if you play
your cards right.

-   Late shows (starting after 9pm) are 1200 yen.
-   On the first day of every month, you can see shows for 1000 yen, and
    if you are a woman, you can see 1000 yen shows every Wednesday too.
-   University students and high school students can get in for 1500 yen
    as long as they show their student card.
-   JHS and elementary school kids are always 1000 yen.
-   Seniors (above 60 years of age) get in for 1000 yen.
-   Children below 3 get the "amazing" price of 900 yen.

If you have a discount card, I believe you (and a number of your
friends, if you all pay together) can get in for 1500 yen. Note that
almost all discounts are invalid for sneak preview shows (usually shown
on a Saturday, one week before the show opens) and premiers.
