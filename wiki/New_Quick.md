This meat shop is in [Asse](/wiki/Asse "wikilink") at the back of the lower
floor supermarket place (not [Kasumi](/wiki/Kasumi "wikilink")). The prices
are usually about 20 to 25% lower than [Kasumi](/wiki/Kasumi "wikilink") and
the quality etc. is good, much better than
[Hanamasa](/wiki/Hanamasa "wikilink") in my opinion.

==Ordering

New Quick sells meat by weight rather than pre-wrapped. You need to be
able to speak Japanese (at least numbers) or be very good at
communicating to order anything here, because the meat is behind the
counter and you have to ask the assistants what kind of meat and how
much you want in grams. They then wrap it for you and you take the
wrapped packets of meat to the cash register by the vegetable section.

Recommendations
---------------

The ham is good, and the smoked ham is delicious. Chicken and minced
meat are bargains.
