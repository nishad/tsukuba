In addition to the regular national holidays, prefectures have begun
having their own special holiday. For a number of years, now, Ibaraki
schools and local government offices have taken the day off on November
13. For the private sector, however, it is generally business as usual.

One popular event held on this day is a special day at Tokyo Disneyland
for residents of [Ibaraki](/wiki/Ibaraki "wikilink"). If you buy your tickets
locally (at train stations, travel agents and even Hot Spar markets),
the 4800 yen regular passbook ticket is reduced to 3700 yen (2800 yen
for children). If you can afford the time off, it's a great time to go.
Be forewarned, however, that it tends to be very crowded, and so you
can't expect to get on many rides. The "Fantillusion" show and other
features of the park, however, are worth it even if you don't get into
many rides. (Christmas celebrations start on Nov 4.)
