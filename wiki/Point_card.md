What is a point card?
---------------------

Japanese shops almost all seem to have "point card" systems where you
get points every time you shop there. Some shops may not like giving
them out to foreigners, but don't be put off if you think you'll be
going back there.

Point card experiences
----------------------

Having eaten enough [Coco's](/wiki/Coco's "wikilink") meals I have qualified
for a Silver card which gets my family a 5% discount there. If you try
really hard you might get a Gold Card which gives a 10% discount.
