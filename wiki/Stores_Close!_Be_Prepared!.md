For those of you who have not experienced a Japanese style New Year, you
need to be prepared for the closing down of practically everything for
at least 2 days. Most stores close down early on New Year's Eve and
don't reopen until the 2nd or later. This is much shorter than "in the
good old days" when stores were closed down until the 3rd or 4th, but
one still needs to be sure to stock up on the basics, such as bread and
milk. Of perhaps greater significance in this "cash society" is that
many banks will be closed from December 31st to January 3rd. [Cash
machines](/wiki/Cash_machines "wikilink") (ATMs) may not be operational on
Jan. 1, 2 and 3, and so you need to have enough cash on hand for your
expected expenses (plus some for the spur-of-the-moment purchases at the
various New Year's sales you'll run across).
