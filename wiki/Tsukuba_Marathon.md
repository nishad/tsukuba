Tsukuba Marathon begins at 10:30 am starting from the athletic field in
the [University of Tsukuba](/wiki/University_of_Tsukuba "wikilink") and first
proceeding around the loop road within the university before spilling
out on [Higashi Odori](/wiki/Higashi_Odori "wikilink") and proceeding north.
There is also a 10 km race that begins at 11:10, but that remains within
the university.

The marathon course continues up [Higashi
Odori](/wiki/Higashi_Odori "wikilink") past the [High Energy Accelerator
Research
Organization](/wiki/High_Energy_Accelerator_Research_Organization "wikilink")
(KEK) and takes a left towards the Northern Industrial Park. After
looping around that, the course then proceeds south along the
Yatabe-Akeno Bypass until it comes to [Tsuchiura-Gakuen
Sen](/wiki/Tsuchiura_Gakuen_Sen "wikilink") (called Expo Odori along this part
of the road). From there, it proceeds back to downtown Tsukuba and turns
north again on [Nishi Odori](/wiki/Nishi_Odori "wikilink"), where it proceeds
up past [Hiratsuka Odori](/wiki/Hiratsuka_Odori "wikilink") to the road with
the overpass just north of the [Tsukuba Memorial
Hospital](/wiki/Tsukuba_Memorial_Hospital "wikilink"). From there is goes west
back to the university loop and then back down and around into the
athletic field where it ends.

Every year, hundreds of athletes vie for the winner's wreath, with the
times ranging from around 2 and a half hours on up to 4 or more. With a
little calculation, you can figure out just about when to expect the
runners to go by. For instance, the lead runner should turn the corner
onto [Nishi Odori](/wiki/Nishi_Odori "wikilink") (just west of
[Seibu](/wiki/Seibu "wikilink")) at about 12:15.

Every year in November, unsuspecting drivers get caught in traffic jams
caused when roads are closed temporarily to let the marathon runners by.
So plan your trips accordingly.
