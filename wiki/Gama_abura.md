Toad oil, the famous product of [Mount
Tsukuba](/wiki/Mount_Tsukuba "wikilink"). The toads of Mount Tsukuba even made
it as the symbols of Tsukuba. It is oil made from the sweat of toads.

Legend says that the toad is placed in a mirrored box, and begins
sweating because of the terror caused by its own reflection.

The toad oil is celebrated at the [Tsukuba Gama
Festival](/wiki/Tsukuba_Gama_Festival "wikilink").
