Part of the [Skylark](/wiki/Skylark "wikilink") Group of restaurants that also
includes [Bamiyan](/wiki/Bamiyan "wikilink"). There are branches in Tsukuba at
the junction of [Tsuchiura Gakuen Sen](/wiki/Tsuchiura_Gakuen_Sen "wikilink")
and [Nishi Odori](/wiki/Nishi_Odori "wikilink") near the centre of town.

The food is cheap and fairly good quality, except for the [higawari
lunch](/wiki/Higawari_Lunch "wikilink") which is usually pretty greasy.
