Japanese drivers may do things a bit differently from what you expect.
Here are some things to watch out for.

Turning left
------------

It is common for Japanese drivers to slow right down or even halt
completely when turning left. The reason is that pedestrians have
right-of-way at the turns, and it is quite possible for a cyclist to
come whizzing out just as you are turning, so perhaps it's best to
follow their example.

Shadowing
---------

Some Japanese drivers don't like overtaking, so they will sit behind
your car without either overtaking or slowing down, but maintaining the
same position. It can be annoying when you want to change lanes, so the
best thing is to change lanes early.

Signals
-------

Japanese drivers are sometimes very delayed in making left or right
turning signals. It isn't uncommon for a driver to start signalling
after they have already started turning. Don't rely too much on the
signals; use common sense to tell you when they're going to slow down.

Pedestrians
-----------

If you are driving a car and you have an accident involving a
pedestrian, no matter what the circumstances the Japanese police will
treat it as 100% your fault. So be extremely cautious of those randomly
wavering pedestrians and cyclists. Remember that no matter what they
might do, including running out in front of you as you are driving, if
you hit someone it will be considered **your fault**.
