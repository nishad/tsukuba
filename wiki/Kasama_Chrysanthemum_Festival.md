Held in [Kasama](/wiki/Kasama "wikilink") at Kasama Inari Jinja. Amazing
displays of chrysanthemum bushes bent and formed into fantastic displays
of flowers. Every year, incredible floral displays reminiscent of flower
covered floats in the Rose Parade are on display. But these are not
flowers that have been glued on. They were grown that way! Prizes are
awarded for the best, biggest and most beautiful chrysanthemums, and
with some individual flowers being 30 cm across, some are really huge.

Local Displays
--------------

If going to [Kasama](/wiki/Kasama "wikilink") is a bit far, you can find
interesting displays at several places in the Tsukuba area. The [Mt.
Tsukuba Shrine](/wiki/Mt._Tsukuba_Shrine "wikilink") has always has some very
nice chrysanthemum displays during November, and in past years, local
flower enthusiasts have shown their works of floral art at Matsumi Park,
near the city hall in [Yatabe](/wiki/Yatabe "wikilink") and other such
locations.
