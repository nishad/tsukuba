Kasumi is a big chain of supermarkets in [Ibaraki](/wiki/Ibaraki "wikilink").
In Tsukuba they have branches in [Oho](/wiki/Oho "wikilink"),
[Takezono](/wiki/Takezono "wikilink"), [Repsa Mall](Repsa_Mall "wikilink"),
and [Asse](/wiki/Asse "wikilink").

The best time to shop at Kasumi is at the weekends. Not only do they
lower the prices of lots of items called [koukoku no
shina](koukoku_no_shina "wikilink"), they also give away lots of free
samples, so your kids can stuff themselves while you're not looking.
