Founded by Chizuru Kangoori in 2002, this hair salon and its partner
salon [Le Coeur](/wiki/Le_Coeur "wikilink") went on to win the Wella national
hairdressing award in 2003.

The unusual building, which is often mistaken for a [Mexican
restaurant](/wiki/Mexican_Restaurants "wikilink"), is based on "Santa Fe" and
native American styles.

Glamour's slogan is "It's kickin' you all around!" which allegedly is a
common phrase in American English.
