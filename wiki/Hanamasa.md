A [supermarket](/wiki/Supermarkets "wikilink") which sells meat and other
things fairly cheaply, but for dry goods [Merci](/wiki/Merci "wikilink") is
much cheaper, and for meat [New Quick](/wiki/New_Quick "wikilink") is as cheap
and much better quality.

Bargains
--------

Bargains to be had include a big bunch of bananas for 300 yen, 1kg
blocks of New Zealand cheddar cheese, very cheap 10kg boxes of
tangerines (in the season), dried apricots for 250 yen, can be found
here, so it is definitely worth a look.

Restaurant has changed
----------------------

There used to be an all-you-can-eat [ yakiniku
restaurant](/wiki/Yakiniku_Restaurants "wikilink") on the upper floor, but
this has changed to a non-all-you-can-eat yakiniku restaurant.

Location
--------

two branches in Tsukuba, one is south of
[Matsushiro](/wiki/Matsushiro "wikilink") and one is near the [Sakura city
office](/wiki/Sakura_city_office "wikilink").
