Tsukuba Toastmasters Club is a branch of the Toastmasters International
club. It is a club for people who want to have an opportunity to
practise their English and develop skills in communication and
leadership. It is not an English lesson, but a group of people who enjoy
making presentations in English in order to improve their language
abilities. Members try to improve their communication skills by making
speeches on various topics. Currently most of the members are Japanese,
but the speeches are done in English.

They usually meet from 2pm to 4:30pm on the 1st and 3rd Saturdays of the
month at Onogawa Kominkan.
