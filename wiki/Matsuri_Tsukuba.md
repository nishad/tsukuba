Tsukuba has two major festivals each year, the International Fair in
May, and Matsuri Tsukuba, usually held on the first weekend in
September. This year Matsuri Tsukuba is being held early to coincide
with the opening of the Tsukuba Express train line.

Matsuri Tsukuba centers around a major parade on Saturday evening along
Tsuchiura-Gakuen Sen in the center of town between Nishi Odori and
Higashi Odori. A number of spectacular "Nebuta" floats will be paraded
along the route first towards the west and then back along the other
side of the road to the East and back again. The "Nebuta" floats are
brought out after it has gotten dark so that the internal lights glow
brightly. Basically made of thin strips of wood covered with colorful
paper, lights inside the floats shine through to make a spectacular
impression.

In order to get a good view, you should try to pick out a spot fairly
early, around 5 pm or so. A number of interesting groups proceed along
the parade route as a preliminary to the unveiling of the Nebuta floats
at dusk. Along the bicycle path between the Expo Center and Takezono
Park, numerous vendors sell the typical carnival items, and so you can
even get your dinner before the main event.

Most events take place along the central bicycle path and adjacent
parks.
