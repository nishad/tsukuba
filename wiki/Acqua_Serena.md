A sports club in [Tokodai](/wiki/Tokodai "wikilink") near [Intel
Tsukuba](/wiki/Intel_Tsukuba "wikilink"). They have a gym, aerobics studio,
and golf practice range. They have a large [swimming
pool](swimming_pool "wikilink") on the second floor, and do lots of
swimming classes for children as well as a "members only" relaxation
pool on the top floor.

The sports club is a little more expensive than [Joyful
Athletic](/wiki/Joyful_Athletic "wikilink"), because it requires a usage fee
of 300 yen for each visit.
