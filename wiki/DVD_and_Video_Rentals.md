Becoming a Member
-----------------

Most video shops like [Tsutaya Club](/wiki/Tsutaya_Club "wikilink") require
some proof of identity and a small deposit (a few hundred yen) to join.
A driving licence or an alien registration card should be enough.

Subtitles vs. Dubbing
---------------------

Most Japanese video shops stock two versions of foreign movies,
subtitled and dubbed. To get the subtitled version, look for the
Japanese words "jimaku suupaa" (character superimposition) rather than
"fukikae" (dubbed) on the video box.
