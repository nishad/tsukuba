Traffic Park is in Tsukuba by [Tsuchiura Gakuen
Sen](/wiki/Tsuchiura_Gakuen_Sen "wikilink").

What is the traffic park?
-------------------------

It is a park with bicycle lanes and miniature traffic lights where
children can learn about traffic rules. However, most of the kids seem
to ignore the traffic lights.

There was also an old steam train which children could climb onto and
play, but this has been removed recently.
