The Tsukuba International Students group is a mailing list for all
things of interest to (post secondary) international students in
Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. The list is open to anyone (all schools, all
nationalities, all occupations, etc.), however all messages sent to this
mailing list should be relevant to people who (1) are coming to Tsukuba
to study, (2) are in Tsukuba studying now, or (3) have studied in
Tsukuba in the past.
