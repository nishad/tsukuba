Love hotels are often used for a short "rest" rather than an overnight
stay. They are known for their outrageous decor and lack of windows. If
discretion is in order, try a love hotel.

Love hotels are associated by many Japanese with prostitution. The areas
around love hotels are often plastered with yellow and pink stickers
with a mobile phone number and words such as [delivery
health](delivery_health "wikilink"). These are advertisements for
prostitutes.
