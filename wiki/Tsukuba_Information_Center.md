The Tsukuba Information Center has some displays about Tsukuba and lots
of information about the place. The main attraction for a lot of foreign
residents is the notice board where one can post adverts. This used to
be the place for [Sayonara Sale](/wiki/Sayonara_Sale "wikilink") announcements
before [TAIRA](/wiki/TAIRA "wikilink") took off.

They also distribute the [Alien Times](/wiki/Alien_Times "wikilink") and the
[Ibaraki Newsletter](/wiki/Ibaraki_Newsletter "wikilink") as well as the free
magazine from Tokyo, [Metropolis](/wiki/Metropolis "wikilink").

There is a reading corner with English language and Japanese language
newspapers, as well as books you can read on the premises. They also run
[Japanese classes](/wiki/Japanese_classes "wikilink") as well as other
cultural activities such as [Ikebana
classes](/wiki/Ikebana_classes "wikilink").
