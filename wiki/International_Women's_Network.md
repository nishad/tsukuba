About the International Women's Network
---------------------------------------

The International Women's Network (IWN) is a group of women who enjoy
chatting with people from all over the world. We exchange information
about the local community while eating a variety of homemade foods. We
meet at a member's house once a month. No reservation is needed. Just
bring one dish of food and show up at the meeting. Newcomers are always
welcome! Take advantage of this unique opportunity to enjoy the
international city of Tsukuba with us!

The International Women's Network exists to create a comfortable
environment for women of all nationalities to gather once a month. In
order to make the environment comfortable, we ask that some basic rules
be observed.

Guidelines
----------

1.  The group is open to all women, regardless of nationality.
2.  Communication on the mailing list and during the events is mainly in
    English, so members must have some English ability. However, all
    languages are welcome and there are no rules about what language to
    use. Members are encouraged to post to the mailing list in English
    or Japanese, but they can use any language during the events.
3.  The group is generally meant for women to have a comfortable place
    to enjoy an evening of conversation and camaraderie, so unless there
    are extenuating circumstances, please do not invite your husbands or
    children to the potluck dinners. We occasionally have picnics and
    other events that are open to all family members.
4.  There are no rules about how much food you should bring to the
    potluck dinners because it is difficult to predict how many people
    will come each month. As a general guideline, try to imagine
    providing at least a taste of your dish to 8 (or more) people. Once
    you have attended one of the dinners, you should be able to get a
    better idea of what is appropriate.
5.  The person who is hosting the potluck dinner provides plates and
    utensils and also drinks. Participants do not have to bring these
    things.
6.  The group is NOT TO BE USED AS A FREE LANGUAGE LESSON. Some teachers
    (both English and Japanese) attend the dinners but they do not want
    to spend their free time discussing grammar. If you would like to
    find a language teacher, feel free to ask for one through our
    mailing list or [TAIRA](/wiki/TAIRA "wikilink").
