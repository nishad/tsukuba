No reservations are necessary, but please contact us for directions to
this month's dinner. It is at a person's house this month (last month it
was at [Ninomiya House](/wiki/Ninomiya_House "wikilink")), so we cannot
publish the details of the location. Contact us for more information.
(If you need a ride to the location, please mention that in your email
and we will arrange for someone to pick you up.)

For past events, please see the [International Women's Network Events
Archive](/wiki/International_Women's_Network_Events_Archive "wikilink").
