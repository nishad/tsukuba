On [Science Odori](/wiki/Science_Odori "wikilink"). About 20% cheaper for some
goods than an average [supermarket](/wiki/Supermarkets "wikilink"). Example: a
bag of strong flour costs 200 yen here. The price of the same bag at
[Kasumi](/wiki/Kasumi "wikilink") or [Hanamasa](Hanamasa "wikilink") is more
than 250 yen. Many other bargains, especially with snack food, which can
be bought at virtually half the price of the same snack in a
[Seven-Eleven](/wiki/Seven-Eleven "wikilink").

Watch out for the best-before date though as they have been known to
sell off nearly-expired items.
