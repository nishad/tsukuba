What is TsukubaWiki?
--------------------

TsukubaWiki exists to help people who visit, live in, or work in
Tsukuba. We currently have [](scratchpad:Statistics "wikilink")
articles. Add to the fun!

Why Tsukuba Needs a Wiki
------------------------

We can think of lots of reasons, but if you are still in doubt, have a
look at our reasons for [Why Tsukuba Needs a
Wiki](/wiki/Why_Tsukuba_Needs_a_Wiki "wikilink").

What's a Wiki?
--------------

A wiki is a collaborative site that focuses on a particular topic. The
Tsukuba Wiki project attempts to harvest the ideas of all of the people
who have information about Tsukuba, so that we can help each other out.

Wikis are collaborative, which means that anyone can contribute to the
site. If you want to change something on this page or any page within
the Tsukuba Wiki, you are welcome to do so.

For a great example of a wiki, see
[Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org).

For examples of what we are trying to do here, have a look at some of
the places on the following page.

Want to Help?
-------------

The basic concept of a wiki is that anyone can create or edit any page.
If you see a link that is [red like this](red_like_this "wikilink") it
means that there is a keyword that is lacking a definition. If you have
information about that word, please share it with us. You can seek out
pages like that, or you can add to or edit information on existing
pages.

If possible, please log in when you make changes so we can all
communicate more easily.

Before you start, please take a look at the [Tsukuba Wiki
Policies](/wiki/Tsukuba_Wiki_Policies "wikilink")
